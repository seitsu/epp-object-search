## Goal
The goal is to create a new EPP extension for Object Search and submit it as an IETF Internet-Draft to develop an [RFC].

## Status
This idea came up in the ICANN registrar community. I developed this first draft to collect ideas and feedback from the broader community.

## Validation of IETF draft
You may validate the [draft] document with https://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.
